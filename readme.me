🏷️ Smart Queue Management System using AWS IoT
A real-time, cloud-based digital queue management system designed for clinics, banks, and customer service centers.
The system enables users to take tokens remotely, track live queue status, and receive notifications when their turn is approaching.
This project showcases AWS cloud architecture, IoT-based real-time communication, and scalable backend design.
📌 Problem Statement
Traditional queue systems require physical presence, leading to:
Long waiting times
Overcrowding
Poor user experience
This project solves the problem by enabling remote token management and real-time queue monitoring.
